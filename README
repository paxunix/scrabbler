Utility page to help players look up words while playing Scrabble.

This was one of my first attempts at DHTML (for you young'ins out there,
that's what all your fancy AJAX-y stuff was called before there was AJAX).

You could enter a set of letters and it would dynamically go scrape some
page Hasbro had set up for people to do word-lookups, then pull out the
relevant lists of words and put them in its own div without all the flash
content and ads and stuff.

My JS, CSS and HTML has evolved since then (hopefully in a positive
direction).
